# User Workflows Analysis

**Status**: Not started

## Objective

Design intuitive editing, review/approval, and navigation workflows for non-IT TC members.

## Key Questions

1. What are typical editing workflows? (add BIE, modify definition, deprecate element)
2. What are common pain points and mistakes?
3. How do users navigate and find elements?
4. What validation and guidance do users need?
5. How should the subcommittee review → TC approval workflow function?
