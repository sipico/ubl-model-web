# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Use SHARED-QUESTIONS.md Instead

**This file is no longer used.**

All cross-persona questions now go in **`analysis/SHARED-QUESTIONS.md`** - the single source of truth for all questions between personas.

## Why the Change?

Individual questions files created silos. A shared document provides:
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Better coordination across all analyses
- ✅ Ability to track question status (OPEN, IN PROGRESS, ANSWERED)
- ✅ No duplication of similar questions

## How to Use SHARED-QUESTIONS.md

1. **Open** `analysis/SHARED-QUESTIONS.md`
2. **Add your question** using the template provided there
3. **Set status** to "🔴 OPEN"
4. **Assign a question number** (e.g., Q5)
5. **Reference it** in your deliverables: "See SHARED-QUESTIONS.md Q#5"

The AR Manager monitors SHARED-QUESTIONS.md and routes questions to appropriate personas.
