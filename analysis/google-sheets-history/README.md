# Google Sheets History Analysis

**Status**: Not started

## Objective

Analyze edit history of the three UBL Google Sheets to understand change patterns, frequency, user behavior, and coordination patterns. This informs UI/UX design, feature priorities, and testing scenarios.

## Key Questions

1. What types of changes are most common? (new rows, modified cells, deletions)
2. Which columns are edited most frequently?
3. How often are changes made and by how many editors?
4. Do multiple people edit simultaneously? Are there conflicts?
5. Where do mistakes and corrections happen most?

## Approach

1. Access Google Sheets revision history via API
2. Export and analyze change patterns
3. Document findings with recommendations for website design
