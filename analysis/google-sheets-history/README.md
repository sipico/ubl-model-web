# Google Sheets History Analysis

## Objective

Analyze the edit history of the three Google Sheets that currently serve as the authoritative source for the UBL model to understand:

1. **Change patterns**: What types of changes are made most frequently?
2. **Change frequency**: How often are changes made?
3. **User behavior**: Who makes changes and when?
4. **Coordination patterns**: How do multiple editors coordinate their work?
5. **Common operations**: What editing operations are most common?

## Why This Matters

Understanding current usage patterns will inform:
- User interface design for the replacement website
- Feature prioritization
- Access control and permissions design
- Validation and error prevention
- Testing scenarios

## Google Sheets Sources

Three separate spreadsheets:

1. **Library**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18o1YqjHWUw0-s8mb3ja4i99obOUhs-4zpgso6RZrGaY
2. **Documents**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1024Th-Uj8cqliNEJc-3pDOR7DxAAW7gCG4e-pbtarsg
3. **Signatures**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T6z2NZ4mc69YllZOXE5TnT5Ey-FlVtaXN1oQ4AIMp7g

## Approach

1. Export revision history from Google Sheets
2. Analyze change patterns and frequency
3. Identify common editing operations
4. Document findings and recommendations
