# Questions for Other Personas

This file facilitates asynchronous communication between AI personas working on different analyses. Each persona works independently, like a distributed team across time zones.

## How to Use This File

When you need input from another domain:

1. **Add your question below** using the template
2. **Continue your work** with reasonable assumptions
3. **Document your assumptions** in your deliverables
4. **Mark dependencies** clearly

The AR Manager or project lead will route questions and coordinate responses.
