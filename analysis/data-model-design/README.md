**Status**: Not started
**Depends on**: Spreadsheet formulas, user workflows

## Objective

Design the database schema that faithfully represents CCTS structure, supports all workflows, and enables efficient querying and GeneriCode export.

## Key Questions

1. How to represent ABIEs, BBIEs, and ASBIEs in relational/document model?
2. How to handle derived values (columns A, J, P, S)?
3. How to model version control and change history?
4. How to support the review/approval workflow?
5. How to efficiently export to GeneriCode format?
