# UBL Model Web - Claude Reference

**Project**: UBL Model Website
**Repository**: sipico/ubl-model-web
**Branch**: claude/ubl-model-website-01K4cNV8XJiShKAHQTWreiBr

## Project Vision

A comprehensive website to:
- Visualize the UBL (Universal Business Language) model
- Maintain and edit the UBL model
- Serve as the authoritative source for GC files that form the basis for UBL release packages

## Current Status

🚧 **Discovery Phase** - Analyzing requirements and documenting desired solution before implementation

## Project Approach

1. **Analysis First** - Understanding the domain, current state, and requirements
2. **Document the Vision** - Define what the ideal solution should be
3. **Design Architecture** - Work backwards from requirements to implementation
4. **Implement** - Build the solution based on documented decisions

## Key Documentation

### Session Logs
All conversation history is maintained in `.claude/sessions/` with timestamps and key decisions.

### Decision Records
Architectural and technical decisions are documented in `.claude/decisions/` with rationale.

## Important Conventions

- **No Code Yet**: Currently in analysis phase - no implementation code until requirements are fully documented
- **Session Documentation**: Conversations are logged after major topics or decisions
- **Naming Convention**: Lowercase for general files, UPPERCASE for this CLAUDE.md

## Quick References

*(To be populated as project evolves)*

## Open Questions

- What is UBL and how is it currently maintained?
- What are GC files and their relationship to the model?
- Who are the intended users?
- What technology stack will be used?
