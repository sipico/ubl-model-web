# Session 01: Project Initiation & Documentation Structure

**Date**: 2025-11-21
**Session ID**: 01K4cNV8XJiShKAHQTWreiBr
**Focus**: Establishing project vision and documentation framework

## Topics Covered
- Initial project vision discussion
- Repository documentation structure
- Best practices alignment

---

## Key Discussions

### [06:35 UTC] Project Vision Introduction

**User Request**:
> "Lets go on a journey together to create a web site where you can see the UBL model, maintain it and is the source for the GC files that are the basis for the UBL releases packages."

**Initial Understanding**:
- Website for UBL model visualization
- Model maintenance capabilities
- Authoritative source for GC files for UBL releases

**Questions Raised**:
- Technology stack preferences
- UBL model structure and format
- GC files definition and format
- Feature priorities
- Deployment requirements

### [06:40 UTC] Approach & Methodology

**Decision**: Analysis-first approach

**User Direction**:
> "Its important that you DO NOT write any code. We are going to do the analysis first and document what we want the solution to be .. and then work our way back from there to see how we want to achieve that"

**Agreed Process**:
1. Understand the domain
2. Define the vision
3. Document requirements
4. Design architecture (working backwards)
5. Implementation (only after clear plan)

**Rationale**: Avoid rework by fully understanding problem space before coding

### [06:45 UTC] Documentation Structure

**Decision**: Establish `.claude` directory for project knowledge management

**Structure Agreed**:
```
.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Main reference (uppercase per best practices)
├── commands/              # Reusable slash commands
├── settings.json          # Tool permissions
├── sessions/              # Conversation history (project-specific)
└── decisions/             # Decision records (project-specific)
```

**Key Points**:
- Follow Anthropic's official best practices
- `CLAUDE.md` in uppercase (per official docs)
- Session logs for tracking conversations and decisions
- Timestamped and arranged by session
- Commit after major topics/decisions

**Rationale**: Create knowledge base for future sessions and team collaboration

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Reference |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| CLAUDE.md (uppercase) | Official Anthropic best practice | [Best Practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) |
| Analysis before code | Avoid rework, ensure complete understanding | User directive |
| Session logging | Track decision history and reasoning | Project requirement |
| .claude directory structure | Align with best practices + project needs | Combined approach |

## Next Steps

- [ ] Define what UBL is and current maintenance process
- [ ] Understand GC files and their role
- [ ] Identify user personas and use cases
- [ ] Document pain points with current system
- [ ] Define success criteria for the website

---

## Open Questions

1. What is UBL and how is it currently maintained?
2. What problems exist with the current approach?
3. What are GC files specifically?
4. Who are the intended users of this website?
5. What features are highest priority?
